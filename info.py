Subcutaneous types include eumycetoma and chromoblastomycosis, which generally affect tissues in and beneath the skin. Systemic fungal infections are more serious and include cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, pneumocystis pneumonia, aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Signs and symptoms range widely. There is usually a rash with superficial infection. Fungal infection within the skin or under the skin may present with a lump and skin changes. Pneumonia-like symptoms or meningitis may occur with a deeper or systemic infection. Diagnosis is generally based on signs and symptoms, microscopy, culture, sometimes requiring a biopsy and the aid of medical imaging. Some superficial fungal infections of the skin can appear similar to other skin conditions such as eczema and lichen planus. Treatment is generally with antifungal medicines, usually in the form of a cream or by mouth or injection, depending on the specific infection and its extent. Some require surgically cutting out infected tissue.")

When people come in contact with something they are allergic to, there can be many different reactions. Their eyes may become very itchy, and their noses may become drippy or stuffy. They may cough and sneeze. They may develop a rash called hives. Their faces may swell up. If it is a food allergy, the person may get an upset stomach. Sometimes a person's oesophagus, or throat, may swell up so much that the person can no longer breathe. This is called anaphylaxis. When this happens, a doctor must give the person a medicine called epinephrine to make the swelling go down. Some people with allergies to very common things, like bee stings or fish, carry this medicine with them so it can be used quickly in an emergency.

Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, damage to the nerves, damage to the eyes and cognitive impairment. Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the cells of the body not responding properly to the insulin produced. There are three main types of diabetes mellitus: Type 1 diabetes results from failure of the pancreas to produce enough insulin due to loss of beta cells. This form was previously referred to as 'insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus' (IDDM) or 'juvenile diabetes'. The loss of beta cells is caused by an autoimmune response. The cause of this autoimmune response is unknown. Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. As the disease progresses, a lack of insulin may also develop. This form was previously referred to as 'non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus' (NIDDM) or 'adult-onset diabetes'. The most common cause is a combination of excessive body weight and insufficient exercise.

Major advances in the understanding of the cellular and molecular physiology of bile secretion have led to identification of genetic defects responsible for the different types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). The potential role of the genes involved in PFIC in some adult cholestatic disorders remains to be determined. The majority of adult patients with chronic cholestasis have primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Recently, variant forms of PBC have been described. The term autoimmune cholangitis is used to describe patients having chronic non-suppurative cholangitis with negative antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) but positive antinuclear and/or antismooth muscle antibodies.

Ultimately, migraines seem to be caused by a combination of factors: genetic, environmental, and lifestyle.Women are more likely to have chronic migraines (migraines that occur 15 days a month or more).
